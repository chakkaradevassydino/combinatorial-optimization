# Minimum Weight Matching

This notebook introduces a basic combinatorial optimization problem
using graph matching.

## Problem Description
Given a graph with weighted edges, the goal is to find a matching
that minimizes the total weight.
import networkx as nx

G = nx.Graph()

edges = [
    ("A", "B", 2),
    ("A", "C", 4),
    ("B", "C", 1),
    ("B", "D", 3),
    ("C", "D", 2)
]

G.add_weighted_edges_from(edges)

matching = nx.algorithms.matching.min_weight_matching(G, weight="weight")
matching
