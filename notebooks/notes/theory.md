# Combinatorial Optimization – Notes

## What is Combinatorial Optimization?
Combinatorial optimization focuses on finding the best solution
from a finite set of possible solutions.

## Matching Problem
A matching is a set of edges without common vertices.

## Minimum Weight Matching
The objective is to select edges such that:
- Each node is used at most once
- Total weight is minimized
